# Changelog

All notable changes to the Croniq Runner SDK for Java are documented here. The
format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial Gradle multi-module skeleton (`core`, `spring-boot-starter`,
  `kotlin-ext`, `conformance-tests`). PR-1 of
  [#133](https://github.com/nuetzliches/croniq/issues/133).
- Convention plugins under `buildSrc/` for shared toolchain, Spotless
  (Palantir Java format), Checkstyle, JUnit 5 config.
- Central dependency catalogue at `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/java-sdk-ci.yml` with schema validation,
  matrix build, conformance suite, and Maven-local publish smoke test.
- Release workflow `.github/workflows/java-sdk-release.yml` — tag-triggered
  (`java-sdk-vX.Y.Z`), builds + signs + publishes all three modules to the
  Sonatype Central Portal via Vanniktech `com.vanniktech.maven.publish`
  with `automaticRelease=true` (no manual portal click).
- `CroniqRunner.sdkVersion()` placeholder API surface — replaced by the
  real runner entry point in PR-2.

### Coordinates

- Group ID: `io.github.nuetzliches` (Sonatype-verified namespace). The
  Java packages remain `io.croniq.runner.*` for clean imports — Maven
  Central does not require package-to-group alignment.
- Artifacts: `croniq-runner` (core), `croniq-runner-spring-boot-starter`,
  `croniq-runner-kotlin-ext`. The `croniq-` prefix disambiguates from
  unrelated projects under the same `io.github.nuetzliches` namespace.

### Notes

- The `0.0.x` line is reserved for pipeline smoke tests — published
  artefacts on Maven Central are immutable, so consumers should wait for
  `0.1.0` (PR-2 of #133) before depending on the SDK.
